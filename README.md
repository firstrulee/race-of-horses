# Horse Racing Game
This is a simple horse racing game. Players can choose a horse and place bets. Based on the bets, the winning probabilities and earnings are calculated. Players can check if their selected horse wins the race.

# How It Works
1. Horse Selection: Players can choose a horse from the available options. Each horse has a realistic winning probability and odds.

2. Placing Bets: Players can place bets on their chosen horse. They specify the bet amount and confirm it.

3. Race Start: When the race starts, the horses begin to race at a certain speed. Each horse progresses with random speed increments.

4. Result Checking: After the race ends, verify if the selected horse is the winner.

5. Earnings Calculation: In the case of a correct prediction, calculate the player's earnings based on the bet amount and the horse's odds.
